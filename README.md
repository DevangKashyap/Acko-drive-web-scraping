Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup-
1-Scraped the Html skeleton: I started by accessing Acko Drive's website to understand its structure .Using Beautiful Soup , I parsed the Html content to get a clear picture of how data is organized.
2-Checked available Hyundai Vehicles: By inspecting the Html elements, I identified the tags and attributes that contain the information. With the right selectors, I was able to know how many Hyundai vehicles available on this site.
3-Detailed data for Hyundai Grand i10 Nios: Diving deeper , I targeted the Hyundai Grand i10 Nios .Using my initial Html parsing as a foundation ,I wrote additional code to extract detailed data about this specific model. This included specifications, pricing, features, and more.
